Solutions for the task asked for the interview
Craft demo
The Accounting team would like to quickly look up country codes to speed up processing of expense reports, they currently have a website bookmarked and the process is manual and tedious. Help them speed things up by creating a simple cli.
•	Write a country lookup service using your favorite programming language.
•	Explore the following API https://www.travel-advisory.info/api
•	Given country code -> return country name example:
lookup --countryCode=AU
Australia


•	Save the data from https://www.travel-advisory.info/api to a file called data.json and add functionality to your program to work with a file instead of real api endpoint
•	Make sure your program supports multiple country codes as input
•	Be ready to demo execution of your program in the terminal
